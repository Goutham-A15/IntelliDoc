## The Dashboard

Your dashboard is the central hub for all your activities. Here you'll find:

-   **Usage Meter:** Keep track of your monthly usage and current subscription plan.
-   **Quick Actions:** Quickly jump to uploading documents or viewing your document list.
-   **Main Tabs:** Switch between uploading, viewing documents, and seeing comparison results.

## Understanding the Analysis Report

When a comparison is complete, the AI generates a detailed report with the following sections:

-   **Summary of Findings:** A high-level overview of the document's consistency.
-   **Contradictions Found:** A list of direct contradictions, including the conflicting statements and an explanation from the AI.
-   **Inconsistencies:** Other logical, factual, or numerical issues that were detected.

## Exporting Reports

For any completed analysis, you can generate a formal report in PDF format from the **"Reports"** tab on your dashboard. This is useful for sharing your findings with colleagues or for your own records.
